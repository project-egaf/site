# Project Everyone Gets A Fandom

## What is Project EGAF?

Read more at our about page

The gist: A whopping 33% (19,094) fandoms exist on <abbr title="Archive Of Our Own">AO3</abbr> that only have 1 work.

EGAF's goal is to add works to these fandoms that have less reach.

## What needs to be done?

Currently EGAF needs help tracking and adding works to our db, we currently use [Astro DB](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/astro-db/) and each entry is entered manually.

This means that right now is data entry.

<details>
    <summary>Do you have a higher technical understanding of Astro DB and love working with data?</summary>
    <p>We're open to automating it, such as uploading a CSV, so long as it doesn't over ride existing work</p>
    <p>Think you know how to do this? Open up an issue and we can talk about it more</p>
</details>

## Where do you need help?

- [ ] Uploading / Entering data
- [ ] Community / Discord
- [ ] Spreading the word
- [ ] Technical Features


Organization is the highest priority, the current plan is to enter in the names of every fandom with 1 work in the Anime/Manga category. The list page will soon have a sort/filter functionality and a way to request the fandom. An upcoming "Want to write" page will be developed with all the fandoms that have been requested, ordered from most requests to least.
